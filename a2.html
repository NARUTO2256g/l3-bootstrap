        <p> In Bootstrap, the container and container-fluid classes are used to define layout containers, but they serve different
        purposes based on their behavior and use cases.
        
        The container class creates a responsive container with a fixed maximum width that adjusts based on the screen size. It
        includes margins on the sides, making it ideal for centered layouts. For example, on large screens, the width is capped
        at 1140px, while on smaller screens, it stretches to fit the viewport width. </p>
